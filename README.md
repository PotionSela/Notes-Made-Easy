## Technologies Used

This project is powered by Express.js on the server side, utilizing JavaScript for both front-end and back-end development. The app also uses Node.js with the file system module, and uniqid for generating unique IDs.


## Installation

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/PotionSela/Notes-Made-Easy.git`
2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS Code, install it.
3. Using the terminal, install Node.js v16.
4. Once Node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, run the command `npm init -y` to initialize and create a `package.json` where project files will be stored.
5. Next, use the terminal to run the command `npm i` to install the dependencies associated with this application. Developers may need to install inquirer directly from the command line. To do so, the command for inquirer will be `npm i inquirer@9.2.12` to install v9.2.12 of inquirer.
6. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command `node server.js`.

## Usage Information

To run this application, use the command line to navigate to the directory of the application, install all dependencies (`npm i`), then type the command `node server.js`. You will then have the server up and running, you can then go to your browser and type in `localhost:3001` and will be directed to a webpage that will gladly take any note you would like to write.
